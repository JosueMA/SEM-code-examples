#' Read the data:
Data <- read.csv("StarWars.csv", sep = ",")

#' This data encodes the following variables:
#' 
#'   - Q1: I am a huge Star Wars fan! (star what?)
#'   - Q2: I would trust this person with my democracy.
#'   - Q3: I enjoyed the story of Anakin's early life.
#'   - Q4: The special effects in this scene are awful (Battle of Geonosis).
#'   - Q5: I would trust this person with my life.
#'   - Q6: I found Darth Vader'ss big reveal in "Empire" one of the greatest moments in movie history.
#'   - Q7: The special effects in this scene are amazing (Death Star Explosion).
#'   - Q8: If possible, I would definitely buy this droid.
#'   - Q9: The story in the Star Wars sequels is an improvement to the previous movies.
#'   - Q10: The special effects in this scene are marvellous (Starkiller Base Firing).
#'   - Q11: What is your gender?
#'   - Q12: How old are you?
#'   - Q13: Have you seen any of the Star Wars movies?

#' Let's say we are interested in seeing if people >= 30 like the original trilogy better than people < 30.
#' First we can make a grouping variable:
Data$agegroup <- ifelse(Data$Q12 < 30, "young", "less young")

#' Let's look at the distribution:
table(Data$agegroup) #' Pretty even...

#' Test for configural invariance:
Model <- '
Prequels =~ Q2 + Q3 + Q4 + Q1
Original =~ Q5 + Q6 + Q7 + Q1
Sequels =~ Q8 + Q9 + Q10 + Q1
Q4 ~~ Q10
'
conf <- cfa(Model, Data, group = "agegroup", std.lv=TRUE)

#' Look at fit:
conf #' P > 0.05 so we do not reject exact fit!
fitMeasures(conf) #' Looks good!

#' Test for weak invariance:
weak <- cfa(Model, Data, group = "agegroup",
            group.equal = "loadings", std.lv=TRUE)

#' Compare groups:
anova(conf,weak) #' Weak variance is accepted

#' Test for strong invariance:
strong <- cfa(Model, Data, group = "agegroup",
            group.equal = c("loadings","intercepts"), std.lv=TRUE)

#' Compare groups:
anova(conf,weak, strong) #' Questionable... 

#' What do the residuals tell us?
residuals(strong) #' Some misfit in Q8 and Q10 in both groups

#' And the lagrange multiplier tests?
lavTestScore(strong)$uni %>% arrange(-X2)

#' Tells me .p37 and .p39., which parameters are those:

parameterEstimates(strong)[37:39,]
#' Intercepts for Q8 and Q10, Q10 is the highest

#' Lets' try freeing up intercept for Q10 on special effects (this is also reasonable, it could be that older
#' people judge special effects on different criteria than younger people).
strong_partial <- cfa(Model, Data, group = "agegroup",
              group.equal = c("loadings","intercepts"),
              group.partial = "Q10 ~ 1", std.lv=TRUE)

#' Compare:
anova(conf,weak, strong_partial) 
#' The partial strong invariance model can be accepted

#' Test for strict invariance:
strict <- cfa(Model, Data, group = "agegroup",
              group.equal = c("loadings","intercepts","residuals",
              "residual.covariances"),
              group.partial = "Q10 ~ 1", std.lv=TRUE)

#' Compare:
anova(conf,weak, strong_partial, strict) 
#' Strict invariance can be accepted!

#' ### Now we can test for homogeneity! 
#' Are the variances and covariances equal?
eqvars <- cfa(Model, Data, group = "agegroup",
              group.equal = c("loadings","intercepts","residuals",
                              "residual.covariances",
                              "lv.variances","lv.covariances"),
              group.partial = "Q10 ~ 1", std.lv=TRUE)


#' Compare:
anova(strict, eqvars)  

#' This is acceptable. What about the means?
eqvars_and_means <- cfa(Model, Data, group = "agegroup",
              group.equal = c("loadings","intercepts","residuals",
                              "residual.covariances",
                              "lv.variances","lv.covariances",
                              "means"),
              group.partial = "Q10 ~ 1", std.lv=TRUE)

#' Compare:
anova(strict, eqvars, eqvars_and_means) 

#' Homogenous means can be rejected! Let's look at the means:
parameterEstimates(eqvars)[82:84, ] #' I looked before and saw rows 82-84 are the ones of interest

#' Interestingly, People >= 30 seem to like the prequels more and the sequels less than people < 30!
